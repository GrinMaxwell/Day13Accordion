# Accordion Menu

### Assignment: Make an Accordion menu where when clicked the content for that section appears

#### Difficulties
1. Some issues getting the CSS for hover and focus to work as specifically as I want. I asked Jess and it looks like the biggest problem was that my selector wasn't properly selecting all the right elements I wanted.
2. I had the darn transition half working for 2 seconds (before I figured out how to make it the right height) but it doesn't seem to want to work again. Maybe I'll ask about it tomorrow.
